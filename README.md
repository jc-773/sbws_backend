# sbws_backend
A backend web service with a couple of endpoints to retrieve basic and advanced NBA player stats.

There is a separate service that I have created to retrieve and store this data in a NoSQL database.

These endpoints read from said database, so until I package this application in a container along with it's database, you wont receive any data from the endpoints as of 12/02/24. 

Regardless, the Swagger doc for this app can be found here once the app is running: http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui/index.html
