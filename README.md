# sbws_backend
A ready to go backend for getting NBA player projections for upcoming games. All you need is an OcpAminSubscriptionKey. In the near future a key will be provided.

With a key, you can clone this repo, run the server locally, and retrieve data surrounding a current player, a current team, or matchups between requested teams.




To run the server and standup the API's navigate to the @SpringBootApplication application class:
src > main > java > com > mysql > example > demo > DemoApplication.java


APIs: (A swagger doc is coming soon... I Promise)
